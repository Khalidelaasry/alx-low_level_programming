# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Description

This project delves deeper into pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It involves tasks that require manipulating strings, understanding pointers, and working with arrays.

## Project Files

1. **0-reset_to_98.c** - Contains a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
2. **1-swap.c** - Contains a function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. **2-strlen.c** - Contains a function that returns the length of a string.
4. **3-puts.c** - Contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
5. **4-print_rev.c** - Contains a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. **5-rev_string.c** - Contains a function that reverses a string.
7. **6-puts2.c** - Contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
8. **7-puts_half.c** - Contains a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
9. **8-print_array.c** - Contains a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. **9-strcpy.c** - Contains a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

##  Advanced Tasks

11. **100-atoi.c** - Contains a function that converts a string to an integer.
12. **101-keygen.c** - Contains a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

## Header File

- **main.h** - Contains all the function prototypes used in the project.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What are pointers and how to use them.
- What are arrays and how to use them.
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays.
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them.
- Scope of variables.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Your code should not use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are allowed to use the standard library.
