# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository contains projects and tasks related to low-level programming in the C language. The projects focus on building a strong foundation in programming concepts, memory management, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Projects

1. **0x00. C - Hello, World**: Introduces the basics of C programming, including compilation, variables, and the `printf` function.

2. **0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while**: Covers basic conditional statements (if-else) and loops (while) in C.

3. **0x02. C - Functions, nested loops**: Expands on C programming by introducing functions and nested loops.

4. **0x03. C - Debugging**: Debugging exercises to practice identifying and fixing code issues.

5. **0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**: Building on the previous project, this one introduces more complex functions and nested loops.

6. **0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings**: This project delves into pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in C.

7. **0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings**: Further explores pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language, introducing more complex tasks, including string manipulation, array reversal, and other operations.

8. **0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings**: Further advanced practice with pointers, arrays, and strings.
