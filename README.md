# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository contains  projects and tasks related to low-level programming in the C language. The projects focus on building a strong foundation in programming concepts, memory management, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Projects

1. **0x00. C - Hello, World**: Introduces the basics of C programming, including compilation, variables, and the `printf` function.

2. **0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while**: Covers basic conditional statements (if-else) and loops (while) in C.

3. **0x02. C - Functions, nested loops**: Expands on C programming by introducing functions and nested loops.

4. **0x03. C - Debugging**: Debugging exercises to practice identifying and fixing code issues.

5. **0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**: Building on the previous project, this one introduces more complex functions and nested loops.

6. **0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings**: This project delves into pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in C.

7. **0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings**: Further explores pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language, introducing more complex tasks, including string manipulation, array reversal, and other operations.

8. **0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings**: Further advanced practice with pointers, arrays, and strings.
 
9. **0x08. C - Recursion**: Introduction to recursive programming in C.
    
10. **0x09. C - Static libraries**: This project covers creating and using static libraries in C programming.

11. **0x0A. C - argc, argv**: Introduction to command line arguments in C.

12. **0x0B. C - malloc, free**: This project explores dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free` functions.

13. **0x0C. C - More malloc, free**: Further practice with dynamic memory allocation.

14. **0x0D. C - Preprocessor**: This project covers the usage of preprocessor directives in C.
   
16. **0x0E. C - Structures, typedef**: Introduction to structures and using `typedef` in C.

17. **0x0F. C - Function pointers**: This project explores the use of function pointers in C.

18. **0x10. C - Variadic functions**: Introduction to variadic functions in C.

19. **0x12. C - Singly linked lists**: Introduction to singly linked lists in C.

20. **0x13. C - More singly linked lists**: Further practice with singly linked lists.

21. **0x14. C - Bit manipulation**: This project covers bitwise operators and bit manipulation in C.

22. **0x15. C - File I/O**: Introduction to file input/output operations in C.
