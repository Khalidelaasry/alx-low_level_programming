# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

## Description

The "0x04-more_functions_nested_loops" project is part of the ALX School Low-Level Programming curriculum and focuses on expanding your knowledge of C programming by introducing more complex functions and nested loop structures.

## Project Files

1. `0-isupper.c` - Checks for uppercase character.
2. `1-isdigit.c` - Checks for a digit (0 through 9).
3. `2-mul.c` - Multiplies two integers.
4. `3-print_numbers.c` - Prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
5. `4-print_most_numbers.c` - Prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
6. `5-more_numbers.c` - Prints the numbers from 0 to 14.
7. `6-print_line.c` - Draws a straight line in the terminal.
8. `7-print_diagonal.c` - Draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
9. `8-print_square.c` - Prints a square using the `#` character.
10. `9-fizz_buzz.c` - Implements the Fizz-Buzz game.
11. `10-print_triangle.c` - Prints a triangle using the `#` character.
12. `100-prime_factor.c` - Finds and prints the largest prime factor of a given number.
13. `101-print_number.c` - Prints an integer .


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to:

- Understand and implement more complex functions in C.
- Work with nested loop structures for various purposes.
- Print numbers and patterns using loops.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills in C programming.

## Requirements

### C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of each project, containing a description of the project.
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
