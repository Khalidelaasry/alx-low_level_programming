# 0x10. C - Variadic Functions

## Description

The project `0x10. C - Variadic Functions` introduces the concept of variadic functions in C. Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. This project provides hands-on experience in working with variadic functions and understanding how to use them effectively in a C program.
