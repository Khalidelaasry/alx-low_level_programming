# 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists

## Description

The project `0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists` builds on the concepts of singly linked lists from the previous project. This project includes additional operations like inserting nodes, deleting nodes, finding loops, and more.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a deeper understanding of singly linked lists and their operations.
- Learn to manipulate linked lists for various purposes like inserting, deleting, and reversing.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).

## Usage

To use the functions provided in this project, include the `lists.h` header file in your C file and call the functions as needed.
