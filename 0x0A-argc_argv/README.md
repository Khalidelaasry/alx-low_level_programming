# 0x0A-argc_argv

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and working with command line arguments in C programming. Command line arguments allow you to pass information to a C program when it is executed in the terminal. The program can then use this information to perform specific tasks or calculations.

## Files

1. `0-whatsmyname.c`- Prints the name of the program itself.
   
2. `1-args.c`- Prints the number of arguments passed to the program.
   
3. `2-args.c`- Prints all arguments it receives, one per line.

4. `3-mul.c`- Multiplies two numbers passed to the program.

5. `4-add.c`- Adds positive numbers passed to the program.

6. `100-change.c`- Prints the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to pass command line arguments to a C program.
- Learn to access and manipulate command line arguments in the program.
- Practice using `argc` and `argv` to handle input from the command line.
- Implement basic arithmetic operations using command line arguments.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
