# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description

This repository contains projects and tasks related to recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to accomplish a task.

## Project Files

1. `0-puts_recursion.c` - Contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

2. `1-print_rev_recursion.c` - Contains a function that prints a string in reverse.

3. `2-strlen_recursion.c` - Contains a function that returns the length of a string.

4. `3-factorial.c` - Contains a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

5. `4-pow_recursion.c` - Contains a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

6. `5-sqrt_recursion.c` - Contains a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

7. `6-is_prime_number.c` - Contains a function that checks if a number is prime.

8. `7-is_palindrome.c` - Contains a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.

9. `100-is_palindrome.c` - Contains a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (Advanced).

10. `101-wildcmp.c` - Contains a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if they can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0 (Advanced).
