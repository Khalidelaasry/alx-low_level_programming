# 0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Description

This project builds on the previous one, further exploring pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It introduces more complex tasks, including string manipulation, array reversal, and other operations.

## Project Files

1. `0-strcat.c` - Contains a function that concatenates two strings.
2. `1-strncat.c` - Contains a function that concatenates two strings, using `n` bytes from `src`.
3. `2-strncpy.c` - Contains a function that copies a string.
4. `3-strcmp.c` - Contains a function that compares two strings.
5. `4-rev_array.c` - Contains a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. `5-string_toupper.c` - Contains a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. `6-cap_string.c` - Contains a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
8. `7-leet.c` - Contains a function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet).

## Advanced Tasks

9. `100-rot13.c` - Contains a function that encodes a string using rot13.
10. `101-print_number.c` - Contains a function that prints an integer.
11. `102-magic.c` - Contains a C program that prints a specific message.
12. `103-infinite_add.c` - Contains a function that adds two numbers stored in strings.
13. `104-print_buffer.c` - Contains a function that prints a buffer in a specific format.

## Header File

- `main.h` - Contains all the function prototypes used in the project.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply pointers to functions.
- Understand arrays of strings and multidimensional arrays.
- Manipulate strings in C.
- Understand and use C's built-in string functions.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Your code should not use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are allowed to use the standard library.
