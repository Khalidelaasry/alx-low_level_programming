# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Description
This project focuses on learning and practicing the concept of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. It includes various tasks to apply and reinforce these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to:

- Understand and implement functions in C.
- Grasp the concept of nested loops and their applications.
- Be able to write C code following the Betty style guidelines.
- Have a solid understanding of various C standard library functions.

## Requirements

### C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked usin.
