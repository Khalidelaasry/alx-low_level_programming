# 0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

## Overview

The "0x17-doubly_linked_lists" project is a collection of C programs that focus on the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists. Each script addresses specific operations related to doubly linked lists, providing a practical understanding of this data structure.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and implementation of doubly linked lists.
- Learn to manipulate doubly linked lists for various purposes, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Gain practical experience in solving challenges related to doubly linked lists.

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- Follow a specific coding style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the repository, providing a description of the repository.

## Usage

To use the functions provided in this project, include the `lists.h` header file in your C file and call the functions as needed.
