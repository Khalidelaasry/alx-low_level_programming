# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

## Description

The project `0x14. C - Bit Manipulation` focuses on bitwise operations  and bit manipulation in the C programming language. It involves various tasks related to performing operations at the bit level.

## Files

1. `0-binary_to_uint.c`
   - Description: A C function that converts a binary number to an unsigned integer.

2. `1-print_binary.c`
   - Description: A C function that prints the binary representation of a number.

3. `100-get_endianness.c`
   - Description: A C function that checks the endianness of a system.

4. `101-password`
   - Description: A file that contains the password for the `crackme3` program.

5. `2-get_bit.c`
   - Description: A C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

6. `3-set_bit.c`
   - Description: A C function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

7. `4-clear_bit.c`
   - Description: A C function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

8. `5-flip_bits.c`
   - Description: A C function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

9. `main.h`
   - Description: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary declarations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of bitwise operations and bit manipulation.
- Learn to perform common operations like setting, clearing, and flipping bits.
- Explore system endianness.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
