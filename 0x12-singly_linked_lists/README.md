# 0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists

## Description

The project `0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists` involves working with singly linked lists in C. A singly linked list is a data structure where each element in the list contains a reference to the next element. This project provides hands-on experience in creating, manipulating, and managing linked lists.

## Files

1. `0-print_list.c`
   - Description: C function to print all elements of a linked list.

2. `1-list_len.c`
   - Description: C function to get the number of elements in a linked list.

3. `2-add_node.c`
   - Description: C function to add a new node at the beginning of a linked list.

4. `3-add_node_end.c`
   - Description: C function to add a new node at the end of a linked list.

5. `4-free_list.c`
   - Description: C function to free the memory used by a linked list.

6. `100-first.c`
   - Description: C function that prints  a message before the `main` function is executed.

7. `101-hello_holberton.asm`
   - Description: Assembly code that prints "Hello, Holberton" to the console.

8. `lists.h`
   - Description: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary declarations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and structure of singly linked lists.
- Learn to create, modify, and manage linked lists in C.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).

## Usage

To use the functions provided in this project, include the `lists.h` header file in your C file and call the functions as needed.
