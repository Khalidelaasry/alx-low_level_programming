# 0x07. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Description

This repository contains projects and tasks related to pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in the C programming language. The tasks become progressively more complex, covering operations like memory setting, memory copying, string search, chessboard printing, and more.

## Project Files

1. `0-memset.c` - Contains a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

2. `1-memcpy.c` - Contains a function that copies memory area.

3. `100-set_string.c` - Contains a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

4. `101-crackme_password` - Contains the password for the [crackme2](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c) executable.

5. `2-strchr.c` - Contains a function that locates a character in a string.

6. `3-strspn.c` - Contains a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

7. `4-strpbrk.c` - Contains a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

8. `5-strstr.c` - Contains a function that locates a substring.

9. `7-print_chessboard.c` - Contains a function that prints the chessboard.

10. `8-print_diagsums.c` - Contains a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
