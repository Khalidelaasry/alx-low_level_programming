# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Description

The project `0x0B-malloc_free` focuses on dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C using `malloc` and `free` functions. Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to allocate memory during runtime, which provides flexibility in handling data structures and storage.

## Files

1. `0-create_array.c`
   - Description: Function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.

2. `1-strdup.c`
   - Description: Function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the given string.

3. `2-str_concat.c`
   - Description: Function that concatenates two strings.

4. `3-alloc_grid.c`
   - Description: Function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers.

5. `4-free_grid.c`
   - Description: Function that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the `alloc_grid` function.

6. `100-argstostr.c`
   - Description: Function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

7. `101-strtow.c`
   - Description: Function that splits a string into words.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`.
- Learn to free allocated memory using the `free` function.
- Practice working with 2-dimensional arrays and strings.
- Implement functions that manipulate and manage dynamically allocated memory.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
