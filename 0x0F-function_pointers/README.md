# 0x0F. C - Function Pointers

## Description

The project `0x0F. C - Function Pointers` explores the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers allow you to store the address of a function and call it later through that pointer. This project provides hands-on experience in working with function pointers and using them to achieve dynamic behavior in a program.

## Files

1. `0-print_name.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `print_name` that takes a name and a function pointer as parameters, and uses the function pointer to print the name.

2. `1-array_iterator.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `array_iterator` that executes a given function on each element of an array.

3. `2-int_index.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `int_index` that searches for an integer in an array using a specified comparison function.

4. `3-main.c`
   - Description: This file contains a main function to test the functionality of the functions in the other files.

5. `function_pointers.h`
   - Description: This header file contains prototypes for the functions mentioned above.

6. `README.md`
   - Description: This README file contains information about the project and the list of files.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of function pointers in C.
- Learn how to use function pointers to achieve  dynamic behavior in a program.
- Practice writing functions that accept function pointers as parameters.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
