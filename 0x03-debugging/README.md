# 0x03. C - Debugging

This project focuses on practicing debugging skills in C programming. Debugging is a critical skill for identifying and fixing errors in code, ensuring that programs run smoothly and efficiently.

## Project Files

1. `0-main.c`: Contains a provided code snippet with a logical error. Your task is to fix the code so that it correctly prints the value of a variable.

2. `1-main.c`: Contains another provided code snippet with a logical error. You need to debug the code to get the correct output.

3. `2-largest_number.c`: Contains a function to find and return the largest of three integers. It may have a logical error, and you need to debug it to ensure correct functionality.

4. `3-print_remaining_days.c`: Contains a function that calculates and prints the remaining days of a year based on a given date. You'll need to debug this code.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

- Understand common debugging tools and techniques.
- Identify and resolve errors in C code.
- Improve code efficiency and reliability through debugging.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc , using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
