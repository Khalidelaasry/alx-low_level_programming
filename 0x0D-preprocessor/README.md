# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Description

The project `0x0D. C - Preprocessor` focuses on the preprocessor directives in the C programming language. Preprocessor directives are commands that are executed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation process. This project introduces various ways to use and leverage the preprocessor for tasks like defining constants, including header files, and performing simple computations.

## Files

1. `0-object_like_macro.h`
   - Description: This header file defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

2. `1-pi.h`
   - Description: This header file defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

3. `2-main.c`
   - Description: A simple C program that prints the name of the source file it was compiled from.

4. `3-function_like_macro.h`
   - Description: This header file defines a macro named `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

5. `4-sum.h`
   - Description: This header file defines a macro named `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of the preprocessor in the C compilation process.
- Learn to use preprocessor directives to define macros, include files, and perform simple computations.
- Explore the applications of macros in C programming.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
