# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

## Description

The project `0x0E. C - Structures, typedef` introduces the concept of structures and typedef in the C programming language. A structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group variables of different data types under a single name. Typedef, on the other hand, is used to create aliases for existing data types, providing more meaningful names and enhancing code readability.

## Files

1. `1-init_dog.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `init_dog` that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.

2. `2-print_dog.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `print_dog` that prints the details of a `struct dog`.

3. `4-new_dog.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `new_dog` that creates a new instance of `struct dog` and initializes its members.

4. `5-free_dog.c`
   - Description: This file contains a function `free_dog` that frees memory allocated for a `struct dog`.

5. `dog.h`
   - Description: This header file contains the definition of the `struct dog` and prototypes for the functions mentioned above.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of structures in C and how they can be used to group related data.
- Learn how to use typedef to create meaningful aliases for data types.
- Practice writing functions that operate on structures.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).
